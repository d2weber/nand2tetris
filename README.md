# Solutions to nand2tetris

These are my solutions following the nand2tetris course with the book "The Elements of Computing Systems - Building a Modern Computer from First Principles" by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken.
Find more information on [the website](https://www.nand2tetris.org/book).
There you will also find a download link to get the necessary tools.
This repository contains the contennt of the `project` directory and should be placed next to the `tools` directory.
That's the same directory structure as in the downloaded zip file.
